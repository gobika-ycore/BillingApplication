# Payment Functionality Setup Guide

## 🎉 Payment Features Implemented

Your SalesBillScreen now includes comprehensive payment functionality similar to your bakery app example!

### ✅ Features Added:
- **Cash Payment**: Immediate confirmation, marked as "paid"

- **Credit Payment**: Deferred payment, marked as "pending"
- **Payment Modal**: Professional interface for payment method selection
- **Bill Integration**: Payment info displayed in bill cards and forms
- **Database Storage**: Payment details saved to Firestore

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Install Required Dependencies
Run the installation script:
```bash
# Option 1: Run the batch file
install-payment-dependencies.bat

# Option 2: Manual installation
npm install react-native-qrcode-svg react-native-svg
```

### 2. Update Configuration
Open `screens/SalesBillScreen.js` and update:

**Line 74** - Replace with your UPI ID:
```javascript
{ id: 'upi', name: 'UPI', icon: 'phone-portrait-outline', upiId: 'your-actual-upi-id@bank' },
```

**Line 16** - Uncomment QRCode import:
```javascript
import QRCode from 'react-native-qrcode-svg';
```

**Line 833** - Uncomment QRCode usage:
```javascript
<QRCode value={upiUri} size={200} />
```

### 3. Test the Implementation
```bash
npx react-native run-android
# or
npx react-native run-ios
```

## 📱 How It Works

### Payment Flow:
1. User fills out sales bill form
2. Clicks "Save Sales Bill"
3. Payment method modal appears
4. User selects payment method (Cash/UPI/Credit)
5. For UPI: QR code is displayed
6. User confirms payment
7. Bill is saved with payment details

### Payment Status Logic:
- **Cash & UPI**: Automatically marked as "paid"
- **Credit**: Marked as "pending" for later collection
- **Status Colors**: Green (paid), Yellow (pending), Red (overdue)

## 🎨 UI Features

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Add New Payment Methods:
Edit the `paymentMethods` array in SalesBillScreen.js:
```javascript
const paymentMethods = [
  { id: 'cash', name: 'Cash', icon: 'cash-outline' },
  { id: 'upi', name: 'UPI', icon: 'phone-portrait-outline', upiId: 'your-upi@bank' },
  { id: 'credit', name: 'Credit', icon: 'card-outline' },
  { id: 'cheque', name: 'Cheque', icon: 'document-outline' }, // New method
];
```

### Modify Payment Status Logic:
Update the `handlePaymentConfirm` function to change status assignment logic.

## 📊 Database Schema

### New Fields Added to Sales Bills:
```javascript
{
  // Existing fields...
  paymentMethod: "cash" | "upi" | "credit",
  paymentStatus: "paid" | "pending",
  paymentDate: "2024-01-15" | null,
  // Updated fields...
  paidAmount: 25000,
  balanceAmount: 0,
  status: "paid" | "pending"
}
```
